# Deep Learning Projects

### 1) Cats vs Dogs Classifier using Transfer Learning (Binary Classification)
#### Concepts used:
1. Transfer Learning (pre-trained InceptionV3 network)
2. Data Augmentation
3. Regularization using Dropouts ( to make network more efficient and prevent overfitting)

### 2) Rock, Paper and Scissors Classifier (Multiclass Classification)
#### Concepts used:
1. Data Augmentation
2. Regularization using Dropouts ( to make network more efficient and prevent overfitting)

### 3) Humans vs Horses Classifier using Transfer Learning
#### Concepts used:
1. Transfer Learning (pre-trained InceptionV3 network)
2. Data Augmentation
3. Regularization using Dropouts ( to make network more efficient and prevent overfitting)
4. Callbacks (stops training when reached at certain level)
